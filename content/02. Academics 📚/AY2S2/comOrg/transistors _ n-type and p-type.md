## info about transistors
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/UAKPwQz.png)
- 2 types of silicon
	- p-type silicon: positive free-carriers (holes)
	- n-type silicon: negative free-carriers (electrons)
- 2 types of transistors
	- p-transistor: *Gate* (- charged), generates electric field that creates a (+ charged) p-type *channel* connecting *sources* & *drain*
	- n-transistor: *Gate* (+ charged), generates electric field that creates a (- charged) n-type *channel* connecting *sources* & *drain*

## CMOS
- Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)
- use both p- & n-type transistors
