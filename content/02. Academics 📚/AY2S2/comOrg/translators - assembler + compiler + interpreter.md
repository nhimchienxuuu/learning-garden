## what is translator in computer
- definition
	- a translator or a programming language processor that converts a computer program from a language to another
	- it takes a program written in source code and converts into machine code
	- it discover and identifies errors during translation
- types of translators
	1. assembler: assembly (src code) -> assembler (translator) -> machine level language (object code)
	2. compiler: 
		- read the complete src program in high level language -> if error free, convert into machine level language
		- specifies errors in the src code at the end of compilation, if any
	3. interpreter
		- convert high-level language to machine level language
		- it converts line by line, then report errors with executable lines' results -> faster than compiler
