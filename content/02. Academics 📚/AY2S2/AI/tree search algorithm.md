## Search algorithm
- Expand out potential plans (tree nodes)
- Maintain a **fringe** (storage) of partial plans under consideration
- Exploration strategy: Try to expand as few tree nodes as possible

- Main questions:
	- Which leaf node to expand next
	- Whether to check for repeated states
	- Data structures for frontier, expanded nodes
