## note
- A search problem consists of:
	- **[[State space]]**: set of possible configurations
	- **Successor function**: transitions between states (with **actions**, **costs**)
	- **Start state** and **goal test**
- Solution: sequence of actions (plan) transforms start state -> goal state
- Search: find a solution if it exists
- Search problem: 
	- [[models]] that abstract away the details of the environment
	- can have different state space sizes depending on the level of abstraction
	- almost always wrong but some are useful
