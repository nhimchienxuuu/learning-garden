## Properties of search algorithm
- complete: guaranteed to find a solution if one exists?
- optimal: guaranteed to find least cost path?
- time complexity?
- space complexity?

- Systematically builds a search tree
- Chooses an ordering of the fringe (unexplored nodes)
- Optimal: finds least-cost plans


## Cartoon of search tree:
- b: branching factor
- m: maximum depth
- s: depth of shallowest solution
- C*: cost of cheapest solution
- 𝜺: minimum arc cost
- Number of nodes in entire tree: $1 + b + b^2 + \cdots + b^m = O(b^m)$
