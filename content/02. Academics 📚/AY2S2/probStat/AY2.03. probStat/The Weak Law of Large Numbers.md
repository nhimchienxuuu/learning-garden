## Insight:
- The weak law of large numbers
	- $X_1, X_2, \cdots,$ are sequence of independent + identically distributed RV, each have finite mean $E[X_i] = \mu$ 
	  for any $\varepsilon > 0$ 
	  $P{\Bigl\{}{\Bigl|}{\frac{X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}}{n}}-\mu{\Bigl|}\geq\varepsilon{\Bigr\}}$  $\to 0$ 
	  as $n \to$ $\infty$
