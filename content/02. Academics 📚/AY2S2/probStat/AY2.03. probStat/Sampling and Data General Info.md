- Lowest level of abstraction, from which information and knowledge are derived
<!--ID: 1708099388688-->


- data
	- set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables
	- lowest level of abstraction
	- info and knowledge are derived from this
	- from sample data â†’ calculate statistic

- statistics
	- a number represents property of the sample
	- an estimate of population parameter
	- what you can obtained from the sample that can represent the parameter / goal of measuring

- parameter
	- numerical characteristic of the whole population, estimated by a statistic
	- goal of measuring / surveying in this case
- Attribute and Variable - "measurable?"
	- Attribute: characteristic of an object that cannot be measured
		- Example: sensibility
	- Variable: something that may or does vary and can be measured
		- Example: height
- Discrete and Continuous Variables - "precisely countable?"
	- Discrete: variable that can only take a countable number of values
		- Example: number of employees
	- Continuous: variable that may take on any value
		- Example: height of people
