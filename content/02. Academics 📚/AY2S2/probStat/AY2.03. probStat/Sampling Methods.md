## Insight:
- Process of selecting a sample of items from a population
- Why using sample instead of census: completeness, cost, time, accuracy
- Sampling frame: list of all those within a population who can be sampled
	- Characteristics: completeness, accuracy, up to date, non-duplication
- Random sampling: every item in the population has an equal chance of being included
	- Drawbacks: unrepresentative sample, scattered population (more spread out rather than focused)
- Quasi-random sampling (method of selecting samples combining random and non-random sampling): approximation to random sampling, includes systematic, stratified, and multistage sampling
	- Systematic: select an element from the list at random and then every kth element
	- Stratified: divide population into homogeneous subgroups and then sample within each subgroup
		- Advantages: representative, precise
		- Disadvantages: not useful when the population cannot be partitioned
	- Multistage: divide the population into groups and then sample within selected groups
		- Advantages: cost, speed, convenience
		- Disadvantages: bias, not truly random
- Non-random sampling: used when the sampling frame cannot be established, includes quota and cluster sampling
	- Quota: segment the population into subgroups and then select subjects from each segment based on a proportion
		- Advantages: time, budget, accuracy
		- Disadvantages: unreliable, biased
	- Cluster: divide the population into groups and then sample all the elements in one or more groups
		- Advantages: convenient, practical
		- Disadvantages: less accurate, less representative
