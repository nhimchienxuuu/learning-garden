## Insight:
- average of a sequence of independent RV have a common distribution will, with probability 1, converge to the mean of that distribution
- The Strong Law of Large Numbers
	- $X_1, X_2, \cdots,$ are sequence of independent + identically distributed RV, each have finite mean $\mu = E[X_i]$. Then, with probability 1,
	  ${\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{n}}{n}}\rightarrow\mu\,\,\,\,\mathrm{as}\,\,\,\,\,n\rightarrow\infty$
	- Apply: use z-test to identify probability
	  for each $a$,
	  $P{\biggl\{}{\frac{X-E[X]}{\sqrt{\operatorname*{Var}(X)}}}\leq a{\biggr\}}\to\Phi(a)$
