# Title
- Null hypothesis:
	- $H_0$: tentative assumption about a population parameter, an assumption to be challenged
- Alternative hypothesis
	- $H_a$: opposite to null hypothesis, a currently testing hypothesis

- Population proportion
	- use [[11 - Interval Estimation#Confidence Interval for Proportion|proportion calculation using z-test]]
	- $p_0$: hypothesized value for the population proportion
	- 3 forms of hypothesis test:
		- $H_0: p \geq p_0, H_a: p < p_0$
		- $H_0: p \leq p_0, H_a: p > p_0$
		- $H_0: p = p_0, H_a: p \neq p_0$
	- Hypothesis test based on the difference btw $\bar{p}$ and $p_0$
	- test statistic: $ts={\frac{{\bar{p}}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{{\frac{p_{0}(1-p_{0})}{n}}}}}$
