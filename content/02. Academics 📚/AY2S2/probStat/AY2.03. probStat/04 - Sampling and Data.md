# Sampling and Data

## Sampling and Data
- DataSet of values of qualitative or quantitative variables
- Lowest level of abstraction, from which information and knowledge are derived
<!--ID: 1708098043484-->


- population: không gian mẫu, toàn bộ x (total clients, total guests)
- data: số liệu thực tế của các variable (1 giờ, 3 ngày, etc)
	- set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables
	- lowest level of abstraction
	- info and knowledge are derived from this
	- from sample data → calculate statistic

- variable: các measuring units của data (hours, minutes, pieces, ...)
- statistics: 
	- a number represents property of the sample
	- an estimate of population parameter
	- what you can obtained from the sample that can represent the parameter / goal of measuring

- parameter
	- numerical **characteristic** of the whole population, estimated by a statistic
	- goal of measuring / surveying in this case

- Attribute and Variable - "measurable?"
	- Attribute: characteristic of an object that cannot be measured
		- Example: sensibility
	- Variable: something that may or does vary and can be measured
		- Example: height
- Discrete and Continuous Variables - "precisely countable?"
	- Discrete: variable that can only take a countable number of values
		- Example: number of employees
	- Continuous: variable that may take on any value
		- Example: height of people

## Types of Data Collection
- Census: data collection about everyone or everything in a population
	- Advantages: high accuracy
	- Disadvantages: expensive, time-consuming, out of date
- Sample survey: data collection from a part of the population
	- Advantages: less expensive, faster
	- Disadvantages: less accurate, depends on sample size and methods
- Primary and Secondary data
	- Primary: data collected directly for the purpose of the survey
	- Secondary: data collected for some other purpose, but can be used for the survey
- Methods of Obtaining Sample Data
	- Observation: gathering data by watching behavior, events, or characteristics in their natural setting
		- Advantages: understand ongoing process or situation, gather data on individual behaviors or interactions, know about physical setting
		- Disadvantages: data collection from individuals may not be realistic
	- Experimentation: testing competing models or hypotheses, or testing existing theories or new hypotheses
	- Qualitative techniques: investigating the why and how of decision making, using smaller but focused samples
	- Questionnaires: series of questions for gathering information from respondents
		- Advantages: quick, cheap, standardized answers
		- Disadvantages: may frustrate respondents, may lead to biased results
		- Methods: phone or personal interviews, postal surveys, self-completion

## Sampling
- Process of selecting a sample of items from a population
- Why using sample instead of census: completeness, cost, time, accuracy
- Sampling frame: list of all those within a population who can be sampled
	- Characteristics: completeness, accuracy, up to date, non-duplication
- Random sampling: every item in the population has an equal chance of being included
	- Drawbacks: unrepresentative sample, scattered population (more spread out rather than focused)
- Quasi-random sampling (method of selecting samples combining random and non-random sampling): approximation to random sampling, includes systematic, stratified, and multistage sampling
	- Systematic: select an element from the list at random and then every kth element
	- Stratified: divide population into homogeneous subgroups (subgroup sharing similar traits) and then sample within each subgroup
		- Advantages: representative, precise
		- Disadvantages: not useful when the population cannot be partitioned
	- Multistage: divide the population into groups and then sample within selected groups
		- Advantages: cost, speed, convenience
		- Disadvantages: bias, not truly random
- Non-random sampling: used when the sampling frame cannot be established, includes quota and cluster sampling
	- Quota: segment the population into subgroups and then select subjects from specific subgroup, not of all population
		- Advantages: time, budget, accuracy
		- Disadvantages: unreliable, biased
	- Cluster: divide the population into groups and then sample all the elements in one or more groups
		- Advantages: convenient, practical
		- Disadvantages: less accurate, less representative

## Survey Methods
- Two main categories: questionnaire and interview
- Two types of questionnaires: postal and group administered
	- Postal: questionnaire sent by mail to respondents
		- Advantages: inexpensive, same questionnaire, respondents’ convenience, time to read
		- Disadvantages: low response rate
	- Group administered: questionnaire filled by respondents in a group setting under supervision
		- Advantages: higher response rate
- Interviews: may be qualitative or quantitative
	- Quantitative: personal and telephone interview
		- Personal: face-to-face conversation between interviewer and respondent
			- Advantages: high response rate, low response errors
			- Disadvantages: time-consuming, expensive, simple questions
		- Telephone: voice conversation between interviewer and respondent
			- Advantages: rapid, no travel, sensitive questions
			- Disadvantages: high refusal rate, short interview
	- Qualitative: focus group
		- Focus group: group of people asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, etc
			- Advantages: data and insights from group interaction, common language
			- Disadvantages: scheduling difficulty

## Questionnaire Design
- Basic rules for questionnaire construction:
	- Each question should be clear, unambiguous, and easy to understand
	- Every respondent should be able to answer every question
	- Each question should relate directly to survey objectives
	- Question should not be biased or make assumptions
	- Do not use double-barreled, long, negative, or guessing questions
