# Title
- hypothesis tests in chap 12 - Hypothesis Test involve 2 population parameters:
	- population mean
	- population proportion
- for hypothesis tests involving population mean, let $\mu_0$: hypothesized value, choose 1 one 3 forms of hypothesis test
	1. $H_0:\mu \ge \mu_0, \ H_a:\mu< \mu_0$, lower one-tailed (left tail)
	2. $H_0: \mu \le \mu_0, \ H_a: \mu> \mu_0$, upper one-tailed (right tail)
	3. $H_0: \mu=\mu_0, \ H_a:\mu\not = \mu_0$, two-tailed
- following the [[Test claim using a confidence interval (a, b)]], the below is the conclusion for each case:
	- Reject $H_0$: there is enough evidence to conclude $H_a$
	- Can/Do not reject $H_0$: do not have enough evidence to conclude $H_a$
