# Title
### Level of significance:
- is the probability of making a [[Type 1 and Type 2 errors & Consequence|Type 1 Error]] when the null hypothesis is true as an equality
- LoS: $\alpha$ (commonly equals to 0.05 or 0.01)
- If the cost of making a Type I error is high, small values of $\alpha$ are preferred. 
	- Like medication, must have small LoS
- If the cost of making a Type I error is not too high, larger values of $\alpha$ are typically used.
	- it is ok to make mistake
- *Significance tests*: Application of hypothesis testing that only control Type 1 error
