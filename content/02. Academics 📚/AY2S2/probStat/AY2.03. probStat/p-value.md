# Title
### Definition
- a probability that provides a measure of $H_a$ against $H_0$, to determine whether $H_0$ should be rejected
### Calculation
- Lower tail test
	- $p = P(z \leq test\;statistic)$
- Upper tail test
	- $p = P(z \geq test\;statistic)$
- Two tail test
	- p = 2 * the probability of lower/upper tail, correspondingly; ts is positive

### Conclusion
- reject $H_0$ if $p-value \leq \alpha$
