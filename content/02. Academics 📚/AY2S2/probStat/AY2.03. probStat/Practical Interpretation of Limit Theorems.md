## Insight:
- Suppose a RV X has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Then
  $S_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$ has mean $n \mu$ & standard deviation $\sigma \sqrt{n}$ 
  $\bar{X_n} = \frac{X_1 + \cdots + X_n}{n}$ has mean $\mu$ & standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
  
  If X normally distributed, $S_n$ and $\bar{X_n}$ are normally distributed for any $n$
  If X not normally distributed, $S_n$ and $\bar{X_n}$ are *approximately* normally distributed provided that $n$ is sufficiently large

- Note:
	- <u>rule of thumb</u>: $n \geq 30$ to indicate n is large enough. Yet, this depends on the normality of the original value X
	- if n observations chosen without replacement from a finite population, n must also be small compared to population size => to ensure observations are approximately independent
