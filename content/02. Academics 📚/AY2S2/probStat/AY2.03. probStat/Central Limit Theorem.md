## Insight:
- basically: sum of large number of independent RV has a distribution of approximately <u>normal</u>
- The Central Limit Theorem
	- $X_1, X_2, \cdots,$ are sequence of independent + identically distributed RV, each have mean $\mu$, var $\sigma^2$
	  The distribution of $\frac{X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}-n\mu}{\sigma{\sqrt{n}}}$ tends to the standard normal, as $n \to \infty$
