# Title
- $\uparrow$  confidence level = $\uparrow$  width of interval
	- higher confidence level = we want to be more confident in our population parameter prediction = must allow more data variability = wider range of interval
	- width of confidence is determined by $2 \cdot z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ = 2 times the margin of error. As confidence level $\uparrow$-> z-score $\uparrow$ -> wider width
