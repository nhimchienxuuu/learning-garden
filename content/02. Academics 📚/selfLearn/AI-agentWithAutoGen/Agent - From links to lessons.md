## description
- from an URL, extract all the content, presented it in bullet points the main ideas and important examples to understand the information provided in the link as comprehensive and full as possible. then format the content into markdown following the heading outlines:
- H1: main content of the URL
- H2: supporting ideas 
- rewrite all the latex formula in correct order in mathjax and add this at the beginning`$\\(` and add this at the end `\\)$`
- bullet points and sub bullet points: explanation and examples

here is an example python script to fetch content from a link. make something similar to this but instead make it accept a Youtube URL as a parameter, it goes and get the transcript from the URL (via the Youtube API, but use a way that does not require an API key. There should be a Youtube API that you can hit directly), extract the video ID, and then use the Youtube Data API to fetch the transcript for that video.
