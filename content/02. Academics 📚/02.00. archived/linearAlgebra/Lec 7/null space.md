# null space
### description
- **null space** of a linear transformation is the set of all vectors that are mapped to the zero vector by the transformation
- **nontrivial null space** is a null space that is not just the zero vector itself
### calculation
- N(A) orthog to $R(A^T)$ , $x \in N(A), y \in R(A^T)$ 
	  -> $x^Ty = 0$
- $N(A) = \{x \in R^n: Ax = 0\}$
