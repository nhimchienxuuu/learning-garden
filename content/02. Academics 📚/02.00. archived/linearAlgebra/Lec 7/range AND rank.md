# range AND rank
### description
- rank: 
	1. **Reduce the matrix to row echelon form**. This means that the matrix should be in a form where all the leading entries (the first non-zero entry in each row) are ones, and all the entries below each leading entry are zeros.
	2. **Count the number of non-full-zero rows in the row echelon form**. This is the rank of the matrix.
	- rank 1: 1 dimension = det()=0
- range: $R(A) = \{Ax: x \in R^n\}$. 
- dimension of R(A)= rank of A = # of linear indep cols (or rows)
- refer to [[inference in LA]]
- $rank (A) = rank (A^T)$
