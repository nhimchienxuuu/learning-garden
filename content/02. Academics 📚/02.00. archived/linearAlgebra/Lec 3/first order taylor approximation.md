# first order taylor approximation
### 
- a linear function that approximates a differentiable function near a given point by using its value and gradient at that point.
- useful for **simplifying complex functions** and **estimating their behavior** around a point of interest.
- used in various applications, such as numerical methods, error analysis, and machine learning algorithms.
- obtained by adding the product of the gradient and the difference between the input variable and the given point to the value of the function at that point.
- $f(x)\approx f(x_{0})+\nabla f(x_{0})^{T}(x-x_{0})+\mathbf{H.O.T.}$
