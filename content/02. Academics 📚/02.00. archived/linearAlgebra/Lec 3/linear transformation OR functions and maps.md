### definition
- different from function transformation as linear transformation can change the type btw input and output (such as from vector to scalar, matrix to vector, etc)
- function is linear if it **preserves scaling and addition property**

### qualify a function transformation as linear transformation
- 1. scalar multiplication is retained
- 2. vector addition of both vector space = sum of each vector space
