# hyperplanes & halfspaces
### hyperplanes & halfspaces
- a hyperplane in $R^n$ is a set of the form: $H=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:a^{\top}x=b\right\}$, $a \in R^n, a \neq 0, b \in R$
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/zKCSBSy.png)
- can be thought of as a hyperplanes as the level sets of linear functions
-  when b=0, it is a set orthogonal to a
- hyperplane separate the space into 2 regions, which are called **half space**
	- $H_- = \{a^Tx \leq b\}$ -> closed halfspace
	- $H_{++} = \{x: a^Tx > b\}$ -> open halfspace
