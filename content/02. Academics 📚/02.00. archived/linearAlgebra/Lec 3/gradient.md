# gradient
### definition
- contain partial derivative of a function wrt each of its input var, arranged in column vector
- $\nabla f(x)={\left[\begin{array}{l l}{{\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_{1}}}}&{\mathbf\cdot\cdot\cdot}&{{\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_{n}}}}\end{array}\right]}^{\top}$
- useful for finding the direction and rate of change of a function at a given point
- used in optimization problems, such as **finding the minimum or maximum value of a function**, by following the opposite or same direction of the gradient, respectively.
- an [[affine|affine function]]
