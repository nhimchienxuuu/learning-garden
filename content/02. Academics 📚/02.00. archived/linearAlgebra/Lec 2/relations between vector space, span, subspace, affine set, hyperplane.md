# relations between vector space, span, subspace, affine set, hyperplane
### 

| **Characteristic** | **Vector Space** | **Span** | **Subspace** | **Affine Set** | **Hyperplane** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Definition | A set of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars | The set of all linear combinations of a set of vectors. | A subset of a vector space | A set of vectors that can be obtained by adding a single vector to the span of a set of vectors.<br><br>can but no need to pass through the origin<br><br>linear + scalar = affine | A subspace of a vector space, dim hype = dim vec space - 1 |
| Linear algebra attributes | closure | closure | closure contain the zero vector of the vector space. | closure contain min 1 vector not in the span of the vectors being added to.<br><br>not necessarily preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication | closure contain min 1 vector not in span of vectors defining hyperplane |
