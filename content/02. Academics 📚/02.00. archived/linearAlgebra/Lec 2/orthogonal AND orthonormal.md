# orthogonal; orthonormal
### orthogonal
- dot product = 0
- each vector orthog to all other vectors -> mutually orthog -> linear indep
- square matrix are orthog if their columns make up orthonormal set of vectors
- for an orthog matrix, its inverse = its transpose ($O^{-1} = O^T$)

### orthonormal
- a vector is orthonormal if: orthogonal + of length 1
- orthonormal -> also linear indep set -> collection of orthonormal vec can be orthonormal basis for a span of S
- transforming into unit vector = multiplying a nonzero vector by the reciprocal of its length to obtain a unit vector = **normalizing**
