# subspace and span
### Subspace
- subspace: 
	- the set of all possible [[linear combination]] of the vectors in a vector space, including 0 vector (which makes it different from **span**)
	- a subset of a vector space

### Span
- the set of all possible [[linear combination]] of the vectors in a vector space, excluding 0 vector

### info on relation
- refer to [[relations between vector space, span, subspace, affine set, hyperplane]]
