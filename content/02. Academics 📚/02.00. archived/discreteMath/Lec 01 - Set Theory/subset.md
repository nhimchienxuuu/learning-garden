- A is a subset of B, and B is a superset of A <=> every element of A is also element of B
- (A is subset of set B: $A \subseteq B$) = (B is superset of set A: $B \supseteq A$)
- **Theorem 4:** For every set S, (i) $\emptyset \subseteq S$, (ii) $S \subseteq S$
- **Remark 1**: A is proper subset of B if (i) A is a subset of B (ii) $A \neq B$
- **Remark 2:** $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$ => $A = B$
