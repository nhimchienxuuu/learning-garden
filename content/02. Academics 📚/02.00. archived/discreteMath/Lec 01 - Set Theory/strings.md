### description
- Given a set $S$ and a natural number $n \in N$,
- $S^n$ is the set of length $n$ ‘strings’. Can be defined as product of $n$ copies of $S$ (i.e., $S \times S \times \cdots \times S$).”
	- $\{0, 1\}^n$: set of all n-bit strings. $n = 3$ -> set is all possible combination of 0 and 1 in string of length 3
	- There are $2^n$ possible strings (8 when n = 3 above)
- $S^*$ is the set of finite length ‘strings’$S^* = S^0 \cup S^1 \cup S^2 \cup ...$, where $S^0$ contains empty string.”
	- $\{0, 1\}^*$: set of all finite-length bit strings. $*$ = any length, even 0. -> set is all possible combinations of 0 and 1 for all possible lengths, including "", "0", and so on
- $[n]$ is the set $\{0, 1, 2, \cdots, n-1\}$
