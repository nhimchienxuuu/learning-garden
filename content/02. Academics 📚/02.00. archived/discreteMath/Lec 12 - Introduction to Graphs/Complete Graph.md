# Complete Graph
### Description:
- Every [[Vertex]] connects to another vertex
- [[Chromatic Number]]: $\chi(K_n)=n$
### special simple graphs
- complete graph on n vertices or $K_n$: simple graph, exactly 1 edge btw each pair of distinct vertices
	- $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges in a complete graph with $n\geq 2$ vertices
- noncomplete graph: simple graph, at least 1 pair of distinct vertices not connected by an edge
