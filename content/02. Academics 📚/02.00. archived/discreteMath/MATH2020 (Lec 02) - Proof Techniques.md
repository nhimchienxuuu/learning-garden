# Proof Techniques
## Proof definitions
### All term definitions:
- **proposition**: a statement that is either true or false
- **axioms**: propositions simply accepted as true
- **predicates**: propositions whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables
- **Implications**: proposition of the form "if P then Q" -> "P implies Q", with P is premise, Q is conclusion

## Basic Proof Techniques (P is premise, Q is conclusion)
### Direct Proof
- To prove P implies Q
- Step 1: assume P, or "If P then..."
- Step 2: show that Q logically follows

### Indirect Proof
- Method 1 (Prove by contrapositive): Assume Q false -> deduct that P is also false
- Method 2 (Prove by contradiction): Assume P is true and Q is false, reach an illogic

### Proof by cases
- split into several cases satisfying the range, and prove with examples
- good when the range is small, or the quantity having to prove is small, can examined each element in the whole range

### Non constructive proof of existence
- does not explicitly construct the example asked, but prove such example exists
- use logical reasoning, without providing specific example 
- eg. game of chomp; proving "there exists irrational x and y such that $x^y$ is rational"
