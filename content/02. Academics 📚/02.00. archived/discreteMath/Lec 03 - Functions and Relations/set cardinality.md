- review [[cardinality]]
- set cardinality: number of elements in a set, either finite or infinite
- Two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality (written as $|A| = |B|$) IFF there exists a bijection $f: A \to B$
- Set $A$ has cardinality $\geq$ set $B$ (written as $|A| \geq |B|$ ) IFF there exists 
	- an injection $g: A \to B$
	- a surjection $g': B \to A$
