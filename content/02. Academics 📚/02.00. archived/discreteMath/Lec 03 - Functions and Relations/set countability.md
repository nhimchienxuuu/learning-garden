### Countable & Uncountable Set
- countable if it has same number of elements as some subset of $\mathbb{N}^+$ or $\mathbb{N}^+$ itself
- include finite and infinite set that is **bijective** with $\mathbb{N^+}$
- a set is countable IFF $|S| â‰¤ |N^+|$
- eg: 
	- set $\mathbb{Z}$ is also countable: alternating between non-negative and negative numbers -> [[Pasted image 20231126161402|here]]
- prove S is countable set:
	- find a bijection between the set S and $\mathbb{N^+}$
- a set not countable is uncountable
	- *Proposition 2*: eg. set of (0, 1); $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
