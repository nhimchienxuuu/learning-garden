# Chromatic Number, $\chi(G)$
### Description:
- The least number of colors needed for a coloring of a graph.
- Denoted by $\chi(G)$, X is chi
- if a graph can be colored with k color -> it is k-colorable
### Some coloring bound:

### Inference
- #Math/discrete/lemma a graph G, with at least one edge is bipartite IFF $\chi(G) = 2$
- #Math/discrete/theorem a graph with maximum degree at most k is (k+1)-colorable
