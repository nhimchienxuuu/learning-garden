# Hamilton Path
### Description:
- A simple path in a graph 𝐺 that **passes through every vertex exactly once**
- Doesn't have to start and end at same node
- delete an edge in [[Hamilton Cycle]] and we have a path
- if have a [[Hamilton Cycle]] => there will be [[Hamilton Path]]. the reverse is not always true
