# oligopoly
## Imperfect competition
- market structures falling between perfect competition and pure monopoly
- includes industries where firms are price takers (have competitors yet do not face so much competition)
	- monopoly are price makers
	- perfect competition are also price takers

## Types of imperfectly competitive markets
- oligopoly (độc quyền):
	- a few sellers, each offering similar / identical product to others
- monopolistic competition
	- many firms selling similar but not identical products
- the four types of market structure (monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition, perfect competition)

## Characteristics of an oligopoly market
- Few sellers offering similar or identical products
- Interdependent firms
- Best off cooperating and acting like a monopolist by producing a small quantity of output and charging a price above marginal cost *(often seen in the form of a cartel / thoả thuận giữa các công ty cạnh tranh để kiểm soát giá - illegal & detrimental to consumers)*
-> because of few sellers, key feature of oligopoly is tension btw cooperation and self-interest

## Duopoly
- simplest type of oligopoly with 2 members

## Competition, monopolies, and cartels
- the duopolists may agree on a monopoly outcome
	- collusion (illegal, implicit)
		- agreement among firms on **quantities to produce / price to charge** (often to deceive or defraud others, involving sharing confidential info, rigging bids, engaging in illegal activities)
		- iow: agreement between businesses to engage in illegal activities, involves deception and fraud
	- cartel (legal, explicit communication)
		- a group of firms acting in unison (work together to control the market for a product, involving setting prices, limiting production and dividing territories
		- iow: group of businesses working to control the market, such as limiting production, lead to higher prices for consumer
- oligopolists would like to form cartels and earn monopoly profit
	- often is impossible
	- antitrust laws prohibit explicit agreements among oligopolists as a matter of public policy.

## The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly
- A Nash equilibrium: situation in which economic actors when interacting with one another, choose their best strategy, given the strategies that all the others have chosen.
- Firms in an oligopoly choose production levels to maximize profit, resulting in output greater than monopoly but less than competition.
- The oligopoly price is lower than the monopoly price but higher than the competitive price (equal to marginal cost).
- Outcomes if oligopoly firms act in their own self-interest:
	- Joint output exceeds monopoly quantity but is less than competitive industry quantity
	- Market prices are below monopoly price but above competitive price
	- Total profits are below monopoly profit

## Impact of Oligopoly Size on Market Outcome
- Increasing the number of sellers influences price and quantity:
	- Output effect: Selling more at the current price increases profits as price is above marginal cost.
	- Price effect: Increasing production raises the amount sold, reducing the price and profit per unit on all units sold.
- As the number of sellers in an oligopoly increases, the market becomes more like a competitive market. The price nears marginal cost, and the produced quantity approaches the socially efficient level.

## Game Theory and Cooperation Economics
- Game theory studies behavior in strategic situations.
- Strategic decisions require each person to consider potential responses from others.
- In an oligopolistic market, each firm acts strategically knowing its profit depends on its <u>production</u> and the production of other firms.

## The Prisoners’ Dilemma
- The prisoners’ dilemma illustrates the challenge of maintaining cooperation. Often, individuals (or firms) don't cooperate even when it would benefit them.
- The prisoners’ dilemma is a specific "game" between two captured prisoners that shows why maintaining cooperation is difficult even when it is mutually beneficial.
- The dominant strategy is the optimal strategy for a player, regardless of the strategies chosen by others.
- Maintaining cooperation is challenging because it is not in the individual player's best interest.

## Oligopolies and the Prisoners’ Dilemma
- Self-interest makes it hard for the oligopoly to maintain a cooperative outcome with **low production, high prices, and monopoly profits**.
<!--ID: 1708098043390-->


## Reasons for Occasional Cooperation
- Firms concerned about future profits will cooperate in repeated games instead of cheating in a single game for a one-time gain.
<!--ID: 1708098043396-->


## Public Policy Regarding Oligopolies
- Cooperation among oligopolists is undesirable from society's perspective because it results in too low production and too high prices.

## Restraint of Trade and Antitrust Laws
- Antitrust laws prohibit trade restraint and market monopolization attempts.
- Key antitrust laws include the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914.

## Controversies over Antitrust Policy
- Antitrust policies may disallow certain business practices with potential benefits:
    - **Resale Price Maintenance**: Suppliers (like wholesalers) mandate retailers to charge a specific price.
	    - Example: A book publisher might tell a bookstore that they have to sell a new book for $20, and the bookstore isn’t allowed to sell it for any other price.
    - **Predatory Pricing**: A large firm slashes its product prices intending to drive competitors out of the market.
	    - Example: A large coffee chain might start selling coffee for $1 a cup. Smaller coffee shops can’t afford to match this price, so they might go out of business.
    - **Tying**: A firm sells two or more of its products together at a single price, rather than separately.
	    - Example: A tech company might sell a computer with a specific software package included. You can’t buy the computer without the software, even if you don’t want it.
