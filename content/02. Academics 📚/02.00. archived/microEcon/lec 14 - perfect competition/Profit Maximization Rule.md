# Profit Maximization Rule
## Definition
- **Marginal revenue (MR)** is the revenue that the additional unit of output would add to total revenue.
- **Marginal cost (MC)** is the cost that the additional unit of output would add to total cost.
	- If MR \> MC, firm should increase the level of output.
	- If MR \< MC, firm should reduce the level of output.
	- If MR = MC, firm produces output level that maximizes its profit.
- Profit maximizing condition: $MR = MC$
- For a perfectly competitive firm, profit is maximized when: $P = MR = MC$
