## PERFECT COMPETITION AND EFFICIENCY

- In the long run: P = MC = ATC min
- Productive efficiency: P = ATC min
	- Goods produced in the least costly way.
	- Price charged consistent with the cost.
- Allocative efficiency: P = MC
	- resources are apportioned among industries to yield the mix of products that is most wanted by the society.
- Maximize the total surplus (CS + PS)
