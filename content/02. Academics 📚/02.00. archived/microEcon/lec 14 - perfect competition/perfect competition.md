# Perfect Competition
## Characteristic of Perfect Competition:
- **Numerous numbers of small firms** : There are many firms and each firm is relatively small in size.
- **Standardized product** : Product is identical or homogenous.
- **Free entry and exit** : There is no barriers to entry or exit the market.
- **Perfect information** : Sellers and buyers have full access to information regarding the product.
- **Price taker** : Each firm is a price taker. It can sell as many products as it wants at the market price. Each firm has no market power.

## Demand
- The firm is a price taker so it can sell as much product as it wants at the market price.
- No matter how many product the firm can sell, it still receives the market price. Thus the demand for a perfectly competitive firm is **perfectly elastic**
