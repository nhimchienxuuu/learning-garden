# short run output decision & short run supply curve
## description
- Because a perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, it can sell as many output as it wants at the market price => how many output would the firm choose to produce and sell, to maximize its profit

## case analysis & decision
- note: P = MR
- Case 1: If P \> ATC → TR \> TC: Firm earns profit → Firm should produce
- Case 2: If P = ATC, the firm breaks even.
- Case 3: If P \< ATC → TR \< TC: Firm incurs loss
	- Case 3.1: AVC \< P \< ATC: Firm incurs loss and should continue to produce.
		- If firm continue to produce: $Loss = TC – TR = TFC + (AVC – P)Q$ (1)
		- When Loss (1) \< Loss (2) ↔ P \> AVC, firm should continue to produce.
	- Case 3.2: P \< AVC: Firm incurs loss and should shut down.
		- If firm shuts down: $Loss = TFC$ (2)
		- When Loss (2) \< Loss (1) ↔ P \< AVC, firm should shut down.
