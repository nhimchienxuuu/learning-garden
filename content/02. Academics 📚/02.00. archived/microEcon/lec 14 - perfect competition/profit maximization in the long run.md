## PROFIT MAXIMIZATION IN THE LONG RUN
- In the short run, each firm has a fixed, unalterable plant.
	- Firms may shut down in the sense that they can produce zero unit of output but they still stay in the business.
	- The number of firms in the industry is given.

- In the long run, all inputs are variable. Firms can change their plant capacities.
	- The decisions to enter or exit the market depend on the profits or losses that firms can make.
	- The number of firms in the industry can increase or decrease as new firms enter or existing firms leave the market.

## LONG RUN DECISION
- In the long run, the firm exits if it incurs loss.
	- TR \< TC
	- TR/Q \< TC/Q
	- P \< ATC

- In the long run, a firm will enter the industry if such an action would be profitable.
	- TR \> TC
	- TR/Q \> TC/Q
	- P \> ATC

## THE LONG RUN SUPPLY
- The long run supply curve for a perfectly competitive firm is the portion of its marginal cost curve that lies above average total cost.
- A perfectly competitive firm's long run supply curve is its marginal cost curve so long as P \> ATC.

## LONG RUN EQUILIBRIUM
- Entry eliminates economic profits.
- Exit eliminates losses.
- Long run equilibrium is where:
	- P = long run ATC
	- Firms earn zero economic profits.
