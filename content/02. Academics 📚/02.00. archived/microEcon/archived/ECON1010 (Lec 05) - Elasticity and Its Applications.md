# Elasticity and Its Applications

## Elasticity 
- allows precise analysis of supply and demand.
- Measures how buyers and sellers respond to market changes.

## The Elasticity of Demand

- Price elasticity of demand: Measures quantity demanded response to price change.
- Determinants:
    - Availability of close substitutes
    - Necessities vs. luxuries
    - Definition of the market
    - Time horizon
	    - the period of time consumer react to the change in price
	    - TED lower in the short run
	    - TED higher in the long run <- can find substiture goods

### Computing Elasticity
- Calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
- Midpoint method preferred for consistent results.

### Types of Demand Curves
1. Inelastic Demand
    - Quantity demanded less responsive to price changes.
    - Price elasticity of demand < 1
2. Elastic Demand
    - Quantity demanded highly responsive to price changes.
    - Price elasticity of demand > 1
3. Perfectly Inelastic
    - Quantity demanded unaffected by price changes.
4. Perfectly Elastic
    - Quantity demanded changes infinitely with any price change.
5. Unit Elastic
    - Quantity demanded changes proportionally to price changes.

### Total Revenue and Elasticity

- Total revenue = price x quantity sold.
- Inelastic demand: Price increase leads to smaller quantity decrease, increasing total revenue.
- Elastic demand: Price increase leads to larger quantity decrease, decreasing total revenue.

## Income Elasticity of Demand

- Measures how quantity demanded responds to changes in consumers' income.
- Calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
<!--ID: 1708098043010-->


### Types of Goods

- Normal Goods: Higher income raises demand.
- Inferior Goods: Higher income lowers demand.
- Necessities: Income inelastic.
- Luxuries: Income elastic.

## The Elasticity of Supply

- Price elasticity of supply: Measures quantity supplied response to price change.
- Calculated as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.
<!--ID: 1708098043019-->


### Determinants of Elasticity of Supply

- Ability to change production amount.
- Time period: More elastic in the long run.
<!--ID: 1708098043022-->


### Computing Elasticity

- Calculated as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.

## Applications of Supply, Demand, and Elasticity

- Analyzing the impact of new agricultural technology on wheat farmers.
- Examining shifts in supply or demand and their effects on market equilibrium.

### Example: Increase in Supply for Wheat

- Shift in supply curve analyzed using supply-and-demand diagram.
- Market equilibrium changes evaluated.

## Summary

- Price elasticity of demand measures responsiveness to price changes.
- Income elasticity measures responsiveness to income changes.
- Price elasticity of supply measures responsiveness to price changes.
- Supply is generally more elastic in the long run.
- Tools of supply and demand applicable in various market scenarios.
