- Study of tax burden sharing.
- Burden depends on price elasticities of supply and demand.
<!--ID: 1708098042921-->


### Tax on Buyers

## Summary

- Price controls: Ceilings and floors.
    - Ceilings: Legal maximum.
    - Floors: Legal minimum.
- Taxes raise revenue, discourage market activity.
- Tax incidence depends on elasticities.
    - Burden on less elastic side of the market.
