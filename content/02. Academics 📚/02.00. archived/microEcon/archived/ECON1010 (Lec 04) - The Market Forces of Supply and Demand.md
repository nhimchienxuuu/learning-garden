# The Market Forces of Supply and Demand
## Introduction

- Supply and demand are fundamental concepts in economics.
- They drive market economies, influencing prices and quantities.

## Markets and Competition

- A market is a group of buyers and sellers for a specific good or service.
- Buyers determine demand, while sellers determine supply.
- Competitive markets have many buyers and sellers, minimizing individual impact on prices.

### Types of Competition

1. Perfect Competition
    - Identical products
    - Numerous buyers and sellers
    - Price takers
2. Monopoly
    - Single seller controls price
3. Oligopoly
    - Few sellers
4. Monopolistic Competition
    - Many sellers with slightly differentiated products

## Demand

- Quantity demanded is what buyers are willing and able to purchase.
- Law of Demand: Quantity demanded decreases as price increases.
- Demand Schedule: Table showing price-quantity relationship.
- Demand Curve: Graphical representation of the relationship.

### Factors Affecting Demand

- Change in Quantity Demanded (Movement along the curve)
- Change in Demand (Shift in the curve)
    - Consumer income
    - Prices of related goods
    - Tastes
    - Expectations
    - Number of buyers

## Supply

- Quantity supplied is what sellers are willing and able to sell.
- Law of Supply: Quantity supplied increases as price increases.
- Supply Schedule: Table showing price-quantity relationship.
- Supply Curve: Graphical representation of the relationship.

### Factors Affecting Supply

- Change in Quantity Supplied (Movement along the curve)
- Change in Supply (Shift in the curve)
    - Input prices
    - Technology
    - Expectations
    - Number of sellers

## Supply and Demand Together

- Equilibrium: Price where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.
<!--ID: 1708098042969-->


### Components of Equilibrium

- Equilibrium Price: Balances supply and demand.
- Equilibrium Quantity: Quantity supplied and demanded at the equilibrium price.
<!--ID: 1708098042972-->


### Equilibrium Conditions

- Surplus: Excess supply, prices decrease.
- Shortage: Excess demand, prices increase.
- Law of supply and demand: Prices adjust to balance quantity supplied and demanded.

## Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium

1. Identify whether the event affects supply, demand, or both.
2. Determine the direction of the shift (left or right).
3. Use supply-and-demand diagram to analyze changes in price and quantity.

## Summary

- Model of supply and demand analyzes competitive markets.
- Demand curve shows price-quantity relationship.
- Law of demand: Price decrease leads to quantity demanded increase.
- Supply curve shows price-quantity relationship.
- Law of supply: Price increase leads to quantity supplied increase.
- Market equilibrium determined by supply and demand intersection.
- Prices in market economies guide economic decisions and resource allocation.
