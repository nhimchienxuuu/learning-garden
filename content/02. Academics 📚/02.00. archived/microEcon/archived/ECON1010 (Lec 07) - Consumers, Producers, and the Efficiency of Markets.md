## Welfare Economics
- Sub title
	- Studies resource allocation impact on economic well-being.
	- Equilibrium maximizes total welfare for consumers and producers.
	- Maximum benefits for both consumers and producers.
- Consumer Surplus
	- Measures buyer's willingness to pay for a good.
	- Calculation: Buyer's willingness to pay - Amount paid.
	- Graphical Measurement: Area below demand curve and above price.
- Producer Surplus
	- Measures seller's amount received minus cost.
	- Calculation: Amount received by sellers - Cost to sellers.
	- Graphical Measurement: Area below price and above supply curve.
- Market Efficiency
	- Sub title
		- Consumer and producer surplus address if free markets' resource allocation is desirable.
	- Efficiency Calculation
		- Consumer Surplus: Value to buyers - Amount paid by buyers.
		- Producer Surplus: Amount received by sellers - Cost to sellers.
		- Total Surplus: Consumer surplus + Producer surplus or Value to buyers - Cost to sellers.
	- Efficiency Property
		- Resource allocation maximizes total surplus for society.
		- Social planner may also consider fairness in well-being distribution.
- Market Efficiency Insights
	- Allocates supply to buyers valuing goods most.
	- Allocates demand to sellers producing at least cost.
	- Produces goods quantity maximizing consumer and producer surplus.

## Evaluating the Market Equilibrium
- Sub title
	- Equilibrium is efficient resource allocation.
	- Laissez-faire: Leaving market outcome as is.
- Market Power
	- Imperfect competition may lead to market power.
	- Market Power: Ability to influence prices.
- Externalities
	- Occur when market outcome affects others.
	- Welfare depends on more than just buyer and seller values.
	- Inefficient equilibrium when externalities not considered.
