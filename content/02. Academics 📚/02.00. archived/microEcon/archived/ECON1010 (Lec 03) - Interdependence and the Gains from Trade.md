- Economics studies goods distribution to satisfy wants and needs.
<!--ID: 1708098042844-->


## Economic Choices in a Global Economy
- Options: economic self-sufficiency or specialization and trade.
- Specialized production addresses scarcity, raising questions about interdependence.
<!--ID: 1708098042848-->


## Reasons for Interdependence
- Interdependence is beneficial, as specialization and trade make people better off.
- Patterns of production and trade depend on differences in opportunity costs.

## A Parable for Modern Economy
- Illustration: self-sufficiency vs. specialization (potatoes and meat).
- Specialization and trade lead to expanded consumption opportunities.

## Comparative Advantage
- Definition: the ability to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another producer
- Differences in production costs determine what to produce and trade.
- Measurement methods: hours required or opportunity cost of sacrificing one good for another.

## Absolute Advantage
- Definition: the ability to produce more of a good or service than another producer, using the same amount of resources
- Comparison of productivity among producers.
- Absolute advantage is about requiring fewer inputs for production.

## Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage
- Opportunity cost is what must be given up to obtain an item.
- Comparative advantage is based on smaller opportunity cost.
<!--ID: 1708098042868-->

## Summary
