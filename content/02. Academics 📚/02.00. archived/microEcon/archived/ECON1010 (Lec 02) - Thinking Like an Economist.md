## Thinking Like an Economist
- Economics trains you to...
  - Think in terms of alternatives.
  - Evaluate the cost of individual and social choices.
  - Examine and understand how certain events and issues are related.

## The Economist as a Scientist
- The economic way of thinking...
  - Involves thinking analytically and objectively.
  - Makes use of the scientific method.
- The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation
  - Uses abstract models to help explain how a complex, real world operates.
  - Develops theories, collects, and analyzes data to evaluate the theories.
- The Role of Assumptions
  - Economists make assumptions to make the world easier to understand.
  - The art in scientific thinking is deciding which assumptions to make.
  - Economists use different assumptions to answer different questions.

## Economic Models
- Economists use models to simplify reality to improve our understanding of the world.
- Two of the most basic economic models include:
  - The Circular Flow Diagram
  - The Production Possibilities Frontier

### Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram
- The circular-flow diagram is a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms.

### Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier

- The production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology.

- Concepts Illustrated by the Production Possibilities Frontier
  - Efficiency
  - Tradeoffs
  - Opportunity Cost
  - Economic Growth
- PPC shape meaning
	- bowed out: increasing opportunity cost btw the 2 compared products
	- bowed in: decreasing opportunity cost btw the 2 compared products

## Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
- Microeconomics focuses on the individual parts of the economy.
  - How households and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets
- Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole.
  - Economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth

## The Economist as Policy Advisor

- When economists are trying to explain the world, they are scientists.
- When economists are trying to change the world, they are policy advisors.
<!--ID: 1708098042818-->


## Positive Versus Normative Analysis
- Positive statements are statements that attempt to describe the world as it is.
  - Called descriptive analysis
- Normative statements are statements about how the world should be.
  - Called prescriptive analysis
<!--ID: 1708098042822-->


### Positive or Normative Statements?
- Positive
	- An increase in the minimum wage will cause a decrease in employment among the least-skilled.
	- Higher federal budget deficits will cause interest rates to increase.
<!--ID: 1708098042826-->


- normative
	- The income gains from a higher minimum wage are worth more than any slight reductions in employment.
	- State governments should be allowed to collect from tobacco companies the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses among the poor.

## Economists in Washington
- Serve as advisers in the policymaking process of the three branches of government:
  - Legislative
  - Executive
  - Judicial
<!--ID: 1708098042830-->


- Some government agencies that collect economic data and make economic policy:
  - Department of Commerce 
  - Bureau of Labor Statistics 
  - Congressional Budget Office 
  - Federal Reserve Board 

## Why Economists Disagree

- They may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories about how the world works.
- They may have different values and, therefore, different normative views about what policy should try to accomplish.

## Summary
- Economists try to address their subjects with a scientist's objectivity.
  - They make appropriate assumptions and build simplified models to understand the world around them.
  - Two simple economic models are the circular-flow diagram and the production possibilities frontier.
  
- Economics is divided into two subfields:
- Microeconomists study decision-making by households and firms in the marketplace.
- Macroeconomists study the forces and trends that affect the economy as a whole
<!--ID: 1708098042840-->


- A positive statement is an assertion about how the world is.
- A normative statement is an assertion about how the world ought to be.
- When economists make normative statements, they are acting more as policy advisors than scientists.

- Economists who advise policymakers offer conflicting advice either because of differences in scientific judgments or because of differences in values.
- At other times, economists are united in the advice they offer, but policymakers may choose to ignore it.
