- Antitrust laws aim to curb monopoly power and promote competition by preventing mergers, breaking up companies, and stopping activities that reduce market competitiveness.
- Key antitrust laws include 
	- the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890), which reduced the market power of large trusts
	- the Clayton Act (1914), which strengthened government powers and authorized private lawsuits.
