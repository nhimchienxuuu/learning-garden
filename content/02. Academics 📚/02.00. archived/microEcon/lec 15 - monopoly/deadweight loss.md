### description
- A monopoly sets P > MC => creates a **gap** between what consumers are willing to pay and what the producer’s cost is => quantity sold is **less than the socially optimal quantity** (level of output where the social benefit is equal to the social cost) => a **deadweight loss**, which is a loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the equilibrium for a good or a service is not achieved.

### the inefficiency of monopoly

	- monopoly produces < socially efficient quantity of output

### example
* Let’s say a monopoly sells a product at $20, which is above its MC of $10. Consumers are willing to pay up to $15 for the product. However, because the monopoly sets the price at $20, some consumers who value the product at more than $10 (the MC) but less than $20 will not buy the product. This leads to a deadweight loss because these transactions that would have benefited both the consumer and the producer do not occur.

### comparison with tax
- The deadweight loss in a monopoly is similar to the deadweight loss caused by a tax. A tax also creates a gap between what consumers pay and what producers receive, leading to less than the socially optimal quantity being sold.
- The key difference is that in a monopoly, the extra revenue (analogous to the tax) goes to a **private firm**, whereas in the case of a tax, the revenue goes to the **government**.
