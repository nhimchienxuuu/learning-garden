# Public Policy Toward Monopolies
### description
- The government can respond to monopolies in four ways:
    - Making monopolized industries more competitive, see [[Increasing Competition with Antitrust Laws]]
    - Regulating the behavior of monopolies, see [[regulation of monopolies]]
    - Turning some private monopolies into public enterprises, see [[Public Ownership of Monopolies]]
    - Doing nothing if the market failure is deemed small compared to public policy imperfections.
