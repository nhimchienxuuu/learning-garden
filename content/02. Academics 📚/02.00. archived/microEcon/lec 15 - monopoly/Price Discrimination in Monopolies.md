### description
- Price discrimination is the business practice of selling the same good at different prices **to different customers**, even if the production costs for the 2 customers are the same.
- price discrimination is impossible when good is sold in a competitive market, as many firms all selling at the market price -> the firm must have some market power to price discriminate
- Perfect price discrimination occurs when a monopolist knows each customer’s willingness to pay and charges each a different price.
- Price discrimination can (1) increase the monopolist’s profits and (2) reduce deadweight loss.
- Examples of price discrimination include movie tickets, airline prices, discount coupons, financial aid, and quantity discounts.
