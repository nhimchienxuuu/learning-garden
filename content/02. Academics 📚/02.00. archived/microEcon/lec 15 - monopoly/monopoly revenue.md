# Monopoly Revenue
## Total Revenue
- **Total revenue (TR)** is the amount of money that a firm receives from selling its output: $TR = P * Q$
- same as [[total revenue, average revenue, marginal revenue|Perfect Competition Total Rev, Avg Rev, Mar Rev]]

## Average Revenue
- **Average revenue (AR)** is the revenue per unit of output sold: $AR = TR / Q = P$
- same as [[total revenue, average revenue, marginal revenue|Perfect Competition Total Rev, Avg Rev, Mar Rev]]

## Marginal Revenue
- **Marginal revenue (MR)** is the additional revenue that the firm receives when it sells one more unit of output: $MR = ∆TR / ∆Q$ ***<*** $P$
	- different from [[total revenue, average revenue, marginal revenue|Perfect Competition Total Rev, Avg Rev, Mar Rev]] as monopolist MR always < P
	- when monopoly drops the price to sell 1 more unit, the revenue it receive *also decreases*, not additional revenue
	- when monopoly increases the amount it sells -> has 2 effects on total revenue (P x Q)
		- output effect - more output is sold, Q is higher
		- price effect - price falls, P is lower
