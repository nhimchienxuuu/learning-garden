## Types of Monopolies
- **Monopoly Resources**: Monopolies *rarely* arise from exclusive ownership of a key resource.
- **Government-Created Monopolies**: Governments may restrict entry by granting a single firm the exclusive right to sell a particular good in certain markets. Patent and copyright laws are examples of this.
- **Natural Monopolies**: An industry is a natural monopoly when a single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market at a smaller cost than could two or more firms. This arises when there are [[lec 13 - cost production#Economies and Diseconomies of Scale|economies of scale]] over the relevant range of output.
