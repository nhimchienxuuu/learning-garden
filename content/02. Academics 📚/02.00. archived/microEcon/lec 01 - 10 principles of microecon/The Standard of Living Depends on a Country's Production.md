# The Standard of Living Depends on a Country's Production
### description
- Standard of living measured by:
	- Comparing personal incomes
	- Comparing the total market value of a nation's production (OECD)
		- Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
		- a unique forum where the governments of 37 democracies with market-based economies collaborate to develop policy standards to promote sustainable economic growth
- Almost all variations in living standards are explained by differences in countries' productivities
	- Productivity: amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker's time
- Productivity is the ultimate source of living standards
