### description
- Marginal changes: small, incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action
- People make decisions by considering the marginal costs and benefits → make informed choices & maximize utility or outcome
- E.g., comparing a diamond to water
	- If you are in a normal situation: 1 more diamond > 1 more liter of water → diamond in this situation can bring more marginal benefits
	- If in the Sahara desert: 1 more liter of water > 1 more diamond → marginal cost is that water can help you stay hydrated and not die in the middle of the desert
