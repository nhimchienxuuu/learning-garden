# people face tradeoffs (principle 1 _ microecons)
### description
- Principle of Scarcity / There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch / People Face Tradeoffs
	- TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch)
	- Things appearing free always have some cost paid by somebody, and nothing in life is truly free
	- In order to produce, you must give in resources â†’ either you or the other pay the price
	- To get one thing, we have to give up another
	- Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another
- Efficiency vs. Equality
	- Efficiency: Society gets the most it can from its scarce resources
	- Equality: Benefits of those resources are distributed fairly among the members of society
