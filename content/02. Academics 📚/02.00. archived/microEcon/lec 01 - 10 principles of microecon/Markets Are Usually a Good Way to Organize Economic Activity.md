# Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity
### description
- Market economy: Economy allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of firms and households (everyone holds the power to alter the economy) as they interact in the market for goods and services
	- Households decide what to buy, who to work for
	- Firms decide who to hire, what to produce
- Economy in Vietnam
	- Socialist-oriented market economy (current): supply and demand determined by price (market economy with a socialist view)
	- Before 1986, no market = bao cap = what to produce is determined by central command econ, gov order
- "Invisible Hand" #business/microEcons/concepts
	- Households and firms look at prices → decide what to buy and sell → guide them to reach outcomes that maximize the welfare of them or of society as a whole
