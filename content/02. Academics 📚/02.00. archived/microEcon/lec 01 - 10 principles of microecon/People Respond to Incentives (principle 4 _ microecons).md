### description
- Marginal changes in costs or benefits motivate people to respond
	- That's why they usually give a sale off or combo / added up benefits to motivate more sales
- Decision to choose option 1 over another = option 1's marginal benefits > its marginal costs
- If the government wants to protect the environment, reduce carbon footprint
	- Reduce taxes for electric vehicles
	- More taxes / higher prices for private vehicles, lower prices for public vehicles
	- Build an elevated railway to promote traveling in mass to save energy
